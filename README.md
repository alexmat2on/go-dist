# Go Dist 
A selection of distributed algorithms, implemented in Go. The subpackage `graph-core` provides a library for simulating a distributed message passing system, built from goroutines and channels. 

These algorithms are implemented as described by their pseudocode counterparts in the book *Distributed Algorithms for Message-Passing Systems* by Michel Raynal. 

## Algorithms
* `broadcast-traversal`: Parallel Traversal via flooding 

## Build 

`go build`

## Run 

`./go-dist`
